# Utility-AI-Unity
This Unity project implements a Utility AI system for NPCs, enabling them to perform actions such as work, sleep, and eat. The AI system evaluates multiple considerations to determine the most appropriate action at any given time, providing a more realistic and dynamic NPC behavior.
